# Potential Interview Topics
## Abstract Class
* Cannot be instantiated.
* Can be a subclass.
  - If it does not provide implementations for all of the abstract methods, then the subclass must
  also be declared abstract.
* Can declare fields that are not static and final, and define public, protected, and private 
  concrete methods.
* Abstract classes are similar to interfaces.
  - Cannot be instantiated
  - May contain a mix of methods declared with or without an implementation.
## Final Keyword
* Final references must always reference the same object.
* The object to which the variable is referencing cannot be changed.
* The contents of that object may be modified.
* Makes it a constant.
* ALL CAPS.
